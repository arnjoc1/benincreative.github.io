<p>The <b>Exocoetidae</b> are a family of marine fish in the order <i class="taxinomy order">Beloniformes</i> class <i class="taxinomy class">Actinopterygii</i>. Fish of this family are known as <b>flying fish</b>. About 64 species are grouped in seven to nine genera. Flying fish can make powerful, self-propelled leaps out of water into air, where their long, wing-like fins enable gliding flight for considerable distances above the water's surface. This uncommon ability is a natural defense mechanism to evade predators.</p>
<p>The oldest known fossil of a flying or gliding fish, <i>Potanichthys xingyiensis</i>, dates back to the Middle Triassic, 235â€“242 million years ago. However, this fossil is not related to modern flying fish, which evolved independently about 66 million years ago.</p>

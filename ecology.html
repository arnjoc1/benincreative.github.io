<h1>Barbados</h1>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbados">Barbados</a> is known as "the land of the flying fish", and the fish is one of the national symbols of the country. Once abundant, it migrated between the warm, coral-filled Atlantic Ocean surrounding the island of Barbados and the plankton-rich outflows of the Orinoco River in Venezuela.</p>

<p>Just after the completion of the Bridgetown Harbor / Deep Water Harbor in Bridgetown, Barbados saw an increase of ship visits, linking the island to the world. The overall health of the coral reefs surrounding Barbados suffered due to ship-based pollution. Additionally, Barbadian overfishing pushed them closer to the Orinoco delta, no longer returning to Barbados in large numbers. Today, the flying fish only migrate as far north as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobago">Tobago</a>, around 120 <abbr title="nautical miles">nmi</abbr> (220 <abbr title="kilometers">km</abbr>; 140 <abbr title="miles">mi</abbr>) southwest of Barbados. Despite the change, flying fish remain a coveted delicacy.</p>

<p>Many aspects of Barbadian culture center around the flying fish: it is depicted on coins, as sculptures in fountains, in artwork, and as part of the official logo of the Barbados Tourism Authority. Additionally, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coat_of_arms_of_Barbados">Barbadian coat of arms</a> features a pelican and dolphin fish on either side of the shield, but the dolphin resembles a flying fish. Furthermore, actual artistic renditions and holograms of the flying fish are also present within the Barbadian passport.</p>

<h2>Maritime disputes</h2>
<p>In recent times, flying fish have also been gaining in popularity in other islands, fueling several maritime disputes. In 2006, the council of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea fixed the maritime boundaries between Barbados and Trinidad and Tobago over the flying fish dispute, which gradually raised tensions between the neighbours. The ruling stated both countries must preserve stocks for the future. Barbadian fishers still follow the flying fish southward. Flying fish remain an important part of Barbados' main national dish.</p>
